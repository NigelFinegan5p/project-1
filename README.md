## Website design & SEO in Visual Language

Today we are competing with 1000s of other service suppliers across digital boundaries.

The point here is that all good SEO work should show movement upward on Google’s search results or Search Engine Page Results (SERP'S for Short). As Peter Drucker said, the old adage of what gets measured gets managed.

Your ability to earn your way on Page 1 depends mostly on the industry structure and the competitive environment of your industry.

This website is designed with a core focus of visually imparting to the user the focus of this agency, SEO at its heart.

The website is designed with a three page sleek, visually appealing SEO focus allowing the user to easily and precisely locate the information, the core services of the business when they decide to engage or enquire about their services.

The priorities on the site are the fundamental packages on offer to the customer and information about the location of the office.

Each of the three information pages, the user can navigate directly from page title and information via clearly labelled in the links.

The contact page features a form where the users can sign up to our Yellow SEO newsletter and receive free tips and advice. The design is kept clean and simple.

As one of the main business & project objectives is to showcase the core service SEO we went with a Visual first approach.

During extensive competitor research other digital agencies go in-depth with screen shots of analytics and keyword research and overloading potential new customers. For this reason we took the visual first project scope, focusing on a number of primary white and yellow SEO images.

We took a Macro approach to a Micro challenge & problem.

## ***Alignment with customer needs***

At Yellow SEO our aim is to provide **a good solution to the users' demands and expectations**. And to provide real world robust perceptive, penetrating Search Engine Optimization plans for the SME sector in the UK & Ireland.

We aim to produce clearly understandable sector specific plans that are, sector tested, fit for purpose and produce consistent results.


## **Design of the website**

The design of the website is sleek clean and simple.

The website is designed as three separate pages to enable the user to easily and precisely manage their site journey and time on site. 

The primary objective of the site is Brand impact first then information about the core product packages and the office location, thereby bringing new and potential customers along the buyer journey to consderation and coversion. 

From each of the three information pages, the user can navigate directly to the page as it’s clearly labelled.

With the navigation links in the header users are easily able to navigate to the three options.

The landing page shows the primary SEO design logo in yellow and in white and is combined with text detailing the Core Packages available from Yellow SEO

The SEO Services page includes our six step approach to SERP’s (Search Engine Page Results). Additionally a custom banner is located above the footer with a tagline “Let us open doors for you. Try Yellow SEO”. The background picture on the banner shows a closed white door.

The vision of Yellow SEO is building on a core purpose of perceptive, penetrating Search Engine Optimization plans for the SME sector using a pragmatic step by step tested approach.

After extensive competitor analysis we decided for minimal information on the complexities of crawling & indexing,  meta tags, keywords, site structure, load speed, and backlinks. Instead we aimed to avoid this by taking a Macro approach and focus on the big picture first. 
A Macro first then Micro approach.

Alignment of customer needs and understanding user intent was at the fore front of our idea generation, brain storming and note taking for this project. 

To pin down our target audience we created target personas for the users, creating a profile of two business owners, Ethical Edward and Indie the Indulger and there behaviours, habits, wants, needs and expectations.

We looked at the buyer journey and adapted it to our service/package offering in a price/value approach.

**Wireframes**

The initial wireframes are hand sketched and can be seen here. Not all design features were implemented, as the project moved forward, changes were made and ideas developed and tweaked. A second sketch was added later in the project as some of the original ideas needed to be changed and for responsive design.
