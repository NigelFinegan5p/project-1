## Website design & SEO in Visual Language

<a name="website"></a>

Today we are competing with 1000s of other service suppliers across digital boundaries.

The point here is that all good SEO work should show movement upward on Google’s search results or Search Engine Page Results (SERP'S for Short). As Peter Drucker said, the old adage of what gets measured gets managed.

Your ability to earn your way on Page 1 depends mostly on the industry structure and the competitive environment of your industry.

This website is designed with a core focus of visually imparting to the user the focus of this agency, SEO at its heart.

The website is designed with a three page sleek, visually appealing SEO focus allowing the user to easily and precisely locate the information, the core services of the business if they decide to engage or enquire about their services.

The priorities on the site are the fundamental packages on offer to the customer and information about the location of the office.

Each of the three information pages, the user can navigate directly from page title and information via clearly labelled in the links.

The contact page features a form where the users can sign up to our Yellow SEO newsletter and receive free tips and advice. The design is kept clean and simple.

As one of the main project objectives is to showcase the core service of Yellow SEO we went with a Visual first approach.

During extensive competitor research of other digital agencies, we notcied an in-depth analytics and keyword research focus. Instead we aimed to avoid potential information overload for customers. For this reason we took a visual first approach to the project scope, focusing on a number of primary white and yellow SEO images.

We took a Macro approach to a Micro challenge & problem.

## ***Alignment with customer needs***

At Yellow SEO our aim is to provide **a good solution to the users' demands and expectations**. And to provide real world robust perceptive, penetrating Search Engine Optimization plans for the SME sector in the UK & Ireland.

We aim to produce clearly understandable sector specific plans that are, sector tested, fit for purpose and produce consistent results.


## **Design of the website**

<a name="design"></a>
The design of the website is sleek clean and simple.

The website is designed as three separate pages to enable the user to easily and precisely manage their site journey and time on site. 

The primary objective of the site is Brand impact first then information about the core product packages and the office location, thereby bringing new and potential customers along the buyer journey to consderation and coversion. 

From each of the three information pages, the user can navigate directly to the page as it’s clearly labelled.

With the navigation links in the header users are easily able to navigate to the three options.

The landing page shows the primary SEO design logo in yellow and in white and is combined with text detailing the Core Packages available from Yellow SEO

The SEO Services page includes our six step approach to SERP’s (Search Engine Page Results). Additionally a custom banner is located above the footer with a tagline “Let us open doors for you. Try Yellow SEO”. The background picture on the banner shows a closed white door.

The about us page features a form where the users can sign up to a monthly newsletter. After signing up the user moves to a thank you page with an embedded link to the GOOGLE (SOTR) Search Off The Record podcast.

The vision of Yellow SEO is building on a core purpose of perceptive, penetrating Search Engine Optimization plans for the SME sector using a pragmatic step by step tested approach.

After extensive competitor analysis we decided for minimal information on the complexities of crawling & indexing,  meta tags, keywords, site structure, load speed, and backlinks. Instead we aimed to avoid potential information overload by taking a Macro approach and focus on the big picture first. 
A Macro first then Micro approach.

Alignment of customer needs and understanding user intent was at the fore front of our idea generation, brain storming and note taking for this project. 

To pin down our target audience we created target personas for the users, creating a profile of two business owners, Ethical Edward and Indie the Indulger and there behaviours, habits, wants, needs and expectations.

We looked at the buyer journey and adapted it to our service/package offering in a price/value approach.

**Wireframes**

The initial wireframes are hand sketched and can be seen here. Not all design features were implemented, as the project moved forward, changes were made and ideas developed and tweaked. A second sketch was added later in the project as some of the original ideas needed to be changed and for responsive design.

![seo-services](https://github.com/NigelFinegan5p/project-1/blob/main/docs/screenshots/services.jpg)

<br>
<br>

***Languages***

HTML (Hypertext Mark-up Language) was used to design the basic website and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to style the website and make it look more appealing to the site visitors and potential new customers.

<br>

***Fonts & Colors***

<br>

***Color***

<br>

During extensive competitor research of other digital agencies my approach to this project was to create a simple impactful visual approach focusing on a number of primary white and yellow SEO images. We took a Macro approach to a Micro challenge & problem by not bringing in layers of technicalities to the SEO process and risking overloading the site visitor with a tutorial approach.

The following colors are used

-   #ffffff - White
-   #000000 - Black
-   #f2c40f - Yellow

The theme of the colour scheme is minimalist, bright and in alignemnt with the overall mission, vision and values of the business and its core product offering. The background is neutral white for good contrast with the black text overlay.

<br>

***Typography -***

<br>

The font's chosen for the yellow seo project are:

-   Zen Dots
-   Amaranth

The logic behind this decision is that I wanted all of the information provided on the website to be aligned in a brand image, clear, concise and without any unnecessary changes in typography. Additionally a focus was to assist users who may have any level of visual impairment.

<br>


## **Future Features**

<br>

Looking to add additional features to implement as the customer base of Yellow SEO grows the following would be advantageous to the user/customer experience.

Customer service chat window by Intercom AI an (Intercom Customer Service Bot)

Using a service like this to deploy on our website would instantly streamline customer service leads and provide accurate answers to requests and questions in real time.

On the SEO services page & about us page we would like to create custom banners for each page creating a level of individuality within the brand framework for each page.

<br>

## Bugs, Errors & Fixes

<a name="bugs"></a>

At the out set while setting up GitHub and the IDE workspace a number of challenges presented themselves.
Unable to `Git Push` content from the workspace through to Git Hub, an error message appeared requiring authorization.
My approach to troubleshoot this dilemma was to delete the GitHub respository, delete the workspace and reset the chrome extension in a step by step approach. A one, two, three step process was followed. This resolved the push error by creating a new workspace file and respository file.
